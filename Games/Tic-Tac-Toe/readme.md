# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple 2D Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in the C programming language. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking X or O. The objective is to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

2. Player 1 (X) takes the first turn, followed by Player 2 (O).

3. Players take turns marking a cell on the grid by specifying the row and column numbers.

4. The game checks after each move if a player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

5. If a win condition is met, the game declares the player as the winner.

6. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.

2. Compile the C source code using a C compiler. For example:

```shell
gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe
```


3. Run the compiled executable:
- For Windows: `tic_tac_toe.exe`
- For Linux/Mac: `./tic_tac_toe`

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the code to add additional features or change the game logic. Feel free to experiment with different board sizes, win conditions, or player symbols.
